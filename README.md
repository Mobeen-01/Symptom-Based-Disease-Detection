## Introduction

**MediCURE** is an AI-powered web application designed to predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms, providing confidence scores and recommending home remedies for treatment. The app is built with **Flask** and leverages multiple machine learning models trained on a large medical dataset.



> 🚨 **Note:** This project is intended for informational purposes only. It does not replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical concerns.

## Features

✅ **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction:** Uses machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

✅ **Confidence Scoring:** Provides probabilistic confidence scores with each prediction.

✅ **Home Remedies Recommendation:** Suggests natural home remedies tailored to the predicted diseases.

✅ **Comprehensive Dataset:** Trained on a Kaggle dataset containing 8,835 unique rows, 490 distinct symptoms, and 261 distinct diseases.

✅ **Comparative Model Analysis:** Evaluates various ML algorithms to identify the best-performing model.

✅ **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Easy-to-use Flask web application.

✅ **Data Augmentation:** Enhanced dataset via symptom combination expansion.

✅ **Informational Use:** Designed for awareness, **not** as medical advice or diagnosis.
